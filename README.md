# Full-Stack-Crud-Web-App

I designed and implemented a full-stack web application utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. The application seamlessly integrates with a MySQL database managed through XAMPP, showcasing comprehensive skills in web development and database management. Leveraging CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), users can dynamically interact with a list of names. The project also demonstrates proficiency in API communication and showcases experience with XAMPP for local database development.
